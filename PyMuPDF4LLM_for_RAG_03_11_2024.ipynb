              "'of electrolytes and tests of kidney and liver\\nfunction were normal.\\n\\n## DISCUSSION OF MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThis patient has a stomach cancer that appears\\nto be locoregionally advanced on imaging studies.\\nThe first decision regarding management is\\nwhether to resect it immediately or to administer\\npreoperative chemotherapy, with or without\\npreoperative radiation therapy.\\n\\n**Treatment of Locoregionally Advanced**\\n**Gastric Cancer**\\n\\nAlthough surgery is the mainstay of curative\\ntreatment for gastric cancer, even after complete\\nresection, more than half of patients with\\nlocally advanced tumors recur, and fewer than\\n40% survive beyond three years[1]. Accordingly,\\ninvestigators around the world have explored a\\nvariety of adjuvant and neoadjuvant multimodality\\ntreatment approaches to this disease. In North\\nAmerica, the standard approach has long\\nbeen upfront surgery followed by adjuvant\\nchemoradiotherapy, based on the findings of\\nthe Intergroup 0116 trial, which showed that\\npostoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorinbased chemoradiation increases overall survival in\\ncomparison to surgery alone.[2] However, another\\nstandard of care for resectable gastric cancer in\\nNorth America and Europe emerged with the\\npublication of the MAGIC trial[3] a few years later\\nand the FNCLCC/FFCD multicenter phase III trial[4]\\na few years after that. The MAGIC trial reported an\\nimprovement in overall survival with perioperative\\nepirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU (ECF) compared\\nto surgery alone, and the FNCLCC/FFCD trial\\nshowed an improved R0 resection rate and survival\\nwith perioperative 5-FU and cisplatin.\\n\\n\\n## To refer a patient or for a consultation,  visit our physician resources site at  massgeneral.org/GES or call 617-724-1020.\\n\\nGiven this patient’s advanced age and\\nmedical co-morbidities, it was decided by the\\nmultidisciplinary team of surgical oncology,\\nmedical oncology and radiation oncology that the\\nsafest approach would be upfront surgery followed\\nby postoperative chemotherapy and radiation\\ntherapy. The patient was felt to be at high risk for\\ncomplications from either ECF chemotherapy\\nor even a milder regimen of 5-FU, leucovorin\\nand oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy, and\\nwe did not want to preclude the most important\\ncomponent of her treatment for potential cure –\\nthat being a gastrectomy.\\n\\nAccordingly, the patient was cleared for surgery\\nby her cardiologist and primary care physician\\nand was taken to the operating room for a\\nsubtotal gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy.\\nSince gastric cancer frequently spreads to the\\nregional lymph nodes, and since at least 16 lymph\\nnodes should be removed and examined by the\\npathologist for the most accurate staging of gastric\\ncancer[1], we routinely remove not only the lymph\\nnodes immediately adjacent to the stomach (the\\nso-called D1 lymph nodes, in stations 1-6), but\\nwe also remove the second tier of lymph nodes\\nalong the major blood vessels to the liver, stomach\\nand spleen (the so-called D2 lymph nodes, in\\n\\n**FIGURE 2. Lymph node stations including (A) the**\\nperigastric, or D1, lymph nodes (stations 1 to 6), and (B)\\nthe regional, or D2 and D3, lymph nodes (stations 7-16).\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nstations 7-12) (Figures 2A and 2B)[6]. In fact, since\\n2006, we have been performing this technically\\ndemanding “D2 lymphadenectomy” with a low\\nrisk of complications and no deaths, and the\\nmedian number of examined lymph nodes was\\n40, and more than 90% of patients had at least 16\\nlymph nodes examined[5]. In this patient’s particular\\noperation, we removed approximately 80% of the\\nstomach and reconstructed the gastrointestinal\\ntract with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy\\n(Figure 3)[6]. This procedure was accomplished\\nthrough an open approach via an upper midline\\nabdominal incision and was uncomplicated. Her\\npostoperative course was unremarkable, and she\\nwas discharged to home on postoperative day\\nnumber six, eating a soft diet composed of six\\nsmall meals spaced evenly throughout the day.\\n\\n**FIGURE 3. Reconstruction by a retrocolic,**\\nRoux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy.\\n\\n**Pathological Discussion and Role of Adjuvant**\\n**Chemoradiation Therapy**\\n\\nPathological examination showed a 4 cm tumor\\nin the body of the stomach that was moderately\\nto poorly differentiated and was staged as pT3\\n\\n\\n## To refer a patient or for a consultation,  visit our physician resources site at  massgeneral.org/GES or call 617-724-1020.\\n\\n(tumor penetrates subserosa) and pN2 (3 nodes\\npositive out of 31 nodes examined), or stage IIIA[1].\\nAll margins were negative, and there was evidence\\nof both perineural and lymphovascular invasion.\\n\\nBased on the advanced nature of her cancer\\nand the results of the Intergroup 0116 trial,\\nwhich showed a survival advantage for adjuvant\\nchemoradiation therapy, we treated her with\\neight cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy followed\\nby five weeks of 5-FU-based chemoradiation\\ntherapy to 45 Gray. She tolerated all of this therapy\\nremarkably well and remains free of disease\\ntoday. Her chance of long-term survival is on the\\norder of 30%, and it is in large part because of the\\ncoordinated efforts of our team that specializes\\nin gastric cancer that this patient made it through\\nall stages of her treatment and thus has the best\\npossible chance for a cure.\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\n_1.
